  In this project We will cluster district of Istanbul using general information and location data.
We will utilize K-Means clustering algorithm to group boroughs with their similarity and get insight from it.

### INTRODUCTION

 <p>     Istanbul is a big city with huge population and great places to live. But with many options to open a 
restaurant, how we can determine the best places  in exactly true location that is 
supported with data science ? </p>

####Scenario

 <p> In this project, Our stakeholders consider to open a restaurant but they do not have any idea where to
open it . Their restaurant is a fast-food chain that is really famous over the world. They want to open
their restaurants first in Istanbul,since Istanbul is the biggest city in Turkey with their capacity and
population and other advantages </p>
