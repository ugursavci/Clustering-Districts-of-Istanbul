### INTRODUCTION

  Istanbul is a big city with huge population and great places to live. But with many options to open a 
restaurant, how we can determine the best places  in exactly true location that is 
supported with data science ?
  In this project, Our stakeholders aim  to open a restaurant but they do not have any idea where to
open it . Their restaurant is a fast-food chain that is really famous over the world. They want to open
their restaurants first in Istanbul,since Istanbul is the biggest city in Turkey with their capacity and
population and other advantages
